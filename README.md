# Biometric Vector Matcher

A lightweight simulation of biometric verification using cosine similarity between numerical feature vectors.

## Overview
This project generates synthetic biometric vectors and verifies identity by comparing a random input vector against a stored dataset using **cosine similarity**.  
It serves as a conceptual base for scalable face, fingerprint, or voice recognition systems.

## Features
- Random user vector generation  
- Cosine similarity for verification  
- Adjustable similarity threshold  
- Minimal and modular structure  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit-learn**

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn


## Usage
- Run main.py.
- The script generates random biometric vectors and compares a sample against them.
- The console outputs the similarity score and verification result.

## Scalability
- Can evolve into:
- Real biometric systems using face or fingerprint embeddings
- Integration with similarity-based machine learning
- Database-backed biometric identity verification
